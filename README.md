## üéØ Project Overview

#### Objective
Develop an **automated trading pipeline** using ML/DL models to generate buy/sell signals, constructing diversified portfolios that:
1. Outperform IMOEX returns
2. Mitigate risk through sector diversification and RUONIA rate hedging

#### Key Innovations
- **Hybrid strategy**: Combines equities with RUONIA deposits for downside protection
- **Multi-source data**: Integrates endogenous (price data) and exogenous (commodities, FX, bonds) features
- **Advanced feature engineering**: Technical indicators + macroeconomic derivatives
