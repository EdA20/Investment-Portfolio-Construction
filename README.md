A diploma project building a machine learning-powered investment strategy to **consistently outperform** the Moscow Exchange Index (IMOEX). Combines equity selection with risk-managed portfolio construction using RUONIA rates.

## üéØ Project Overview

#### Objective
Develop an **automated trading pipeline** using ML/DL models to generate buy/sell signals, constructing diversified portfolios that:
1. Outperform IMOEX returns
2. Mitigate risk through sector diversification and RUONIA rate hedging

#### Key Innovations
- **Hybrid strategy**: Combines equities with RUONIA deposits for downside protection
- **Multi-source data**: Integrates endogenous (price data) and exogenous (commodities, FX, bonds) features
- **Advanced feature engineering**: Technical indicators + macroeconomic derivatives

|                     Value at Risk (VaR)                    	|   1.93%  	|   3.5%  	|
| Outperformance of portfolio return index over MCFTRR index 	|   48.59  	|  -48.59 	|

#### Interpretation

- The maximum portfolio drawdown (-20%) was significantly lower than the benchmark (-53%)
- The VaR index confirms effective risk control
- The average annualized return consistently outperforms the MCFTRR index
